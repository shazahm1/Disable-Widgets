Disable unused sidebar widgets.

== Description ==

WordPress comes with widgets, themes comes widgets and it seems like every other plugins has its own widgets too. But how many of these do you actually use? If you're like me, only a handful. The rest simply clutter up the Widgets admin page making it more difficult to manage. This plugin does one thing and does it well. It allows you to disable the widgets you're not using.

Usage is very simple and straight forward. Go to the Settings : Disable Widgets admin page, add a check mark to each widget you wish to disable and click the `Update Settings` button. That's it, nothing more to it.
